## Hey, this is Thuviksa! 👋

I ***love*** 💕 to code and develop new ideas 💡, and am currently in a battle ⚔️ between favoring Swift 🐦 the most and favoring Python 🐍 the most. Currently, I have come to the deision that I will favor them both equally, but who knows 🤷‍♀️...

***Anyways***, I’m an upcoming freshman, and am working towards becoming an environmental engineer. I’m passionate about everything environment and I love to create things, especially if they fix a problem.

As for my "weekend hobby" of coding 👩‍💻, I nourish 🌱  it by frequently volunteering for a large variety of ORCSGirls classes and partcipating in the brand new ones. By the way, ORCSGirls is a free non-profit organization stationed in Oak Ridge, Tennessee that provides a wide variety of programming opportunities for girls from grades 5-8, though high schoolers in grades 9-10 are more than welcome to join! 😊
#ORCSGirlsRocks!! 🥳
